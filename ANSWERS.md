- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
class components allow better control over state. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
componentDidMount: only calls once, and gets called as soon as the render() method is called

componentDidUpdate: when state changes it re-renders DOM elements

componentWillUnMount: used to add any ongoing task clean-ups before component unmounts

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
custom hooks are resusable pieces of code and are good for DRY code

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
Testing is great for debugging before you get too far into your code so it doesnt cause further, more serious bugs.
